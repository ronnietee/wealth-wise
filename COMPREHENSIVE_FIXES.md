# Wealth Wise - Comprehensive Fixes Applied

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Currency Display - Truly Global
**Problem**: Currency only working on income page, stuck on $ everywhere else
**Fix**: 
- Added custom event system (`currencyLoaded`) to notify all pages when currency is loaded
- Updated all pages to listen for the `currencyLoaded` event
- Ensured all pages wait for currency before loading data
- Added fallback for when currency is already loaded

### 2. ✅ Dashboard Totals - Fixed Calculation
**Problem**: Total Allocated and Total Spent showing 0.00
**Fix**:
- Simplified `loadDashboardData()` to not wait for user settings
- Fixed calculation logic to properly sum allocated and spent amounts
- Ensured currency is loaded before calculations
- Fixed currency formatting to use user's selected currency

### 3. ✅ Breakdown Page - Ultra-Compact Design
**Problem**: Ribbon too large, categories too narrow, balance cut off
**Fix**:
- **Ultra-Narrow Ribbon**: Reduced to half the previous size (0.05rem padding, 0.15rem margin)
- **Two-Column Layout**: Changed from auto-fit to exactly 2 columns side by side
- **Compact Amounts**: Reduced gaps, font sizes, and padding throughout
- **Balance Visible**: Made amount groups more compact but still show balance
- **Responsive Design**: Amount groups now flex to fit available space

### 4. ✅ Visual Improvements
**Problem**: Various layout and spacing issues
**Fix**:
- **Collapsed Ribbon**: Now ultra-minimal (0.05rem padding, 0.15rem margin)
- **Two-Column Grid**: Categories now display 2 per row instead of auto-fit
- **Compact Amounts**: Reduced gaps from 0.8rem to 0.5rem
- **Smaller Inputs**: Allocation inputs now 80px wide instead of 120px
- **Flexible Layout**: Amount groups now flex to fit available space
