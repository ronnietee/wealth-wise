# Wealth Wise - Final Comprehensive Fixes Applied

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Global Currency - Actually Working
**Problem**: Currency not working globally across all pages
**Fix**: 
- Added immediate currency loading in `base.html` with fallback
- Made all pages load data immediately instead of waiting for currency
- Added currency event listeners as backup
- Ensured currency loads before any data operations

### 2. ✅ Dashboard - Actually Loading Data
**Problem**: Dashboard not loading data, totals showing 0
**Fix**:
- Made dashboard load data immediately on page load
- Removed dependency on currency loading before data loading
- Added currency event listener as backup
- Ensured totals calculate and display correctly

### 3. ✅ Breakdown Page - Fixed Ribbon and Input Width

**Fix**:

- **Fixed Text Sizes**: Restored normal text sizes for subcategory amounts
- **Wider Input**: Increased allocation input width from 80px to 100px
