# Wealth Wise - Final Fixes Applied

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Currency Display - Global and Consistent
**Problem**: Currency not showing correctly across all pages
**Fix**: 
- Added global currency loading in `base.html` that runs on every page
- Removed duplicate currency loading functions from individual pages
- Ensured all pages use the global `userCurrency` variable
- Added proper currency symbol updates for all UI elements

### 2. ✅ Dashboard Totals - Proper Calculation
**Problem**: Total Allocated and Total Spent showing 0.00
**Fix**:
- Fixed `loadUserSettings()` to return a promise
- Updated `loadDashboardData()` to wait for currency loading before calculations
- Ensured proper null checks in calculations
- Fixed currency formatting to use user's selected currency

### 3. ✅ Breakdown Page - Compact Height and Snapped Header
**Problem**: Header taking too much space, gap at top, need balance visible
**Fix**:
- **Header Snapping**: Changed `top: 90px` to `top: 70px` to snap closer to navigation
- **Collapsed Header**: Made much more compact with minimal padding and smaller fonts
- **Height Compactness**: Reduced subcategory row padding from 0.5rem to 0.3rem
- **Balance Display**: Ensured balance is shown for each subcategory (already working)
- **Compact Layout**: Reduced gaps, font sizes, and padding throughout

### 4. ✅ Visual Improvements
**Problem**: Various layout and spacing issues
**Fix**:
- **Collapsed Ribbon**: Now takes minimal space (0.1rem padding, 0.3rem margin)
- **Subcategory Rows**: More compact height with 0.3rem padding
- **Amount Groups**: Smaller gaps (0.1rem) and compact sizing
- **Font Sizes**: Reduced throughout for more compact display
