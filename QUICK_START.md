# Wealth Wise - Quick Start Guide

## Current Status
⚠️ **APPLICATION HAS DATABASE ISSUES** - Needs fixing before use

## What We've Built
A comprehensive Christian family budgeting application with:
- User authentication and management
- Income source tracking
- Category and subcategory management
- Expense tracking and transaction history
- Financial summaries and reporting
- Settings and preferences

## Quick Fix Steps

### 1. Fix Database Issues (CRITICAL)
The main problem is database schema mismatch. Here's how to fix it:

```bash
# Navigate to project directory
cd C:\Users\jtste\wealth-wise

# Delete existing database
del instance\wealthwise.db

# Create fresh database
python -c "from app import app, db; app.app_context().push(); db.create_all()"

# Start application
python app.py
```

### 2. Test Core Functionality
Once the app starts:
1. Go to http://localhost:5000
2. Sign up for a new account
3. Test all major features:
   - Add income sources
   - Create categories/subcategories
   - Allocate funds
   - Add expenses
   - View transactions
   - Change settings

## What's Working
✅ User authentication (signup/login)
✅ Income management (multiple sources)
✅ Category/subcategory management
✅ Expense tracking
✅ Transaction history with edit/delete
✅ Settings (currency, password)
✅ Responsive UI design
✅ Currency display (ZAR, USD, etc.)

## What's Not Working
❌ Application won't start (database errors)
❌ Month management (temporarily disabled)
❌ Some API endpoints may have issues
